# Game Night

Game night is an app that introduces fun to your terminal. No longer do you actually need to pay attention in lectures, or listen to that weird person next to you talk about code! Just load it up and play!

## Game List

### Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is an instant classic. It's been around since the dinosaurs. Rumor has it the comet that killed them was just trying to place an 'O' in the winning spot in the finals of a dino-planetary tic tac toe tournament. It was a brilliant match where everyone involved lost. Except humans, we won, but then we started playing so its only a matter of time...

If you don't know how to play Tic Tac Toe at this stage, you may want to seek some vitamin D as you probably didn't get any from under that rock you've spent your life under.
